# Handwriting-Recognition
The ability to recognize handwriting is an invaluable tool for various organizations and people wanting to convert text into digitized documents. This is especially common in our current digital world, where even chemical laboratories are now working to convert older documents into digital formats on their databases. Not only does it allow for ease-of-access, but this conversion allows documents to be better archived, distributed, and analyzed further.


The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images.


There are numerous prediction methods that have been developed, and knowing when to use each type, based on how it fits the data is key to making a successful prediction. 

In method 1, we looked at naiive Bayed and decision tree models to recognize handwriting .

In method 2, we used SVM, kNN, and Random Forest.
